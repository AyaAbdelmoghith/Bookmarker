# Bookmarker

üîß Technologies Used:</br>
The Bookmarker system is built using cutting-edge technologies:</br>
HTML5 [Semantic Tags]</br>
CSS3 [Media Query]</br>
Bootstrap5 [Utilities, and Layout]</br>
JS [Objects, Array, DOM Selection, DOM Manipulation, Event Listener, CSS Manipulation, and Local Storage]</br>

üìù Bookmark Fields:</br>
Each bookmark has two essential fields:</br>
Name Field: Ensure your bookmark name is at least 3 letters long for meaningful titles, and every name must be unique for easy identification.</br>
URL Field: Save URLs starting with "https://" to ensure secure and encrypted browsing.</br>

‚öôÔ∏è Functions:</br>
Our Bookmarker system offers three fundamental functions:</br>
Visit: Simply click on any bookmark to instantly visit the corresponding website.</br>
Update: Easily modify a bookmark's name or URL to keep your collection accurate and up-to-date.</br>
Delete: Effortlessly remove bookmarks that no longer spark joy, keeping your collection organized and clutter-free.</br>
Search and Highlighting:</br>
To make searching even more convenient, I have added highlighting! All instances of your search term in bookmark names will be highlighted.</br>
