# Bookmarker

üîß Technologies Used:
The Bookmarker system is built using cutting-edge technologies:
HTML5 [Semantic Tags]
CSS3 [Media Query]
Bootstrap5 [Utilities, and Layout]
JS [Objects, Array, DOM Selection, DOM Manipulation, Event Listener, and CSS Manipulation]

üìù Bookmark Fields:
Each bookmark has two essential fields:
Name Field: Ensure your bookmark name is at least 3 letters long for meaningful titles, and every name must be unique for easy identification.
URL Field: Save URLs starting with "https://" to ensure secure and encrypted browsing.

‚öôÔ∏è Functions:
Our Bookmarker system offers three fundamental functions:
Visit: Simply click on any bookmark to instantly visit the corresponding website.
Update: Easily modify a bookmark's name or URL to keep your collection accurate and up-to-date.
Delete: Effortlessly remove bookmarks that no longer spark joy, keeping your collection organized and clutter-free.
Search and Highlighting:
To make searching even more convenient, I have added highlighting! All instances of your search term in bookmark names will be highlighted.
